# ACES
2020/2021 GCU Masters project for Luke Byrne, Ryan Walker, Mateo Alvares, Jamie Hardie, and Kamil Shabkhez.

The ACES (Automated Colaborative Exploration Swarm) system is a comprehensive multi-robot mapping system that uses cutting edge CSLAM and swarm navigation methods. This system is modeled and simulated in the Gazebo environment, and runs all code on ROS / ROS2.

This project is still in development, and therefore further documentation will be coming.
