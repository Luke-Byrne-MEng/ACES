1)Open a new terminal. Firstly we need to specify the IP address for the ROS Master; in this practice it will run in the desktop so the "own address" defined as 127.0.0.1 must be used. This setting is done into the /etc/hosts configuration file. Admin rights are required to edit it so gedit needs to be run as super-user. This is prepending the 'sudo' (superuser do ...) command:
  sudo gedit /etc/hosts
Edit the first line to add the host name 'jet' to the same IP as localhost:
127.0.0.1	localhost jet
and comment out the last line (this one will be used when the ROS Master is running into the robot):
#192.168.137.69 jet
Save the changes and close the editor.

The final IP address and port where the ROS Master can be contacted is set as ROS_MASTER_URI=http://jet:11311 within config file ~./bashrc

2) go into ~/ros_folder/catkin_ws/src/jethost and delete folder jet_gazebo
3) Download jet_sim.zip into ~/ros_folder/catkin_ws/src/ and unzip it (creates own folder)
4) catkin_make
5) source ~/ros_folder/catkin_ws/devel/setup.sh
6) roslaunch jet_gazebo jet_gazebo.launch
7) To test the robot into Gazebo, open a new terminal:
- rostopic list
- rostopic pub -r 2 /cmd_vel geometry_msgs/Twist '{linear: {x: 0.6,y: 0.0, z: 0.0},angular: {x: 0.0,y: 0.0,z: 0.5}}'
